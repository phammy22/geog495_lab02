        <h1>How did Zain Shoe the meme originate?</h1>
        <p>
            Since Zain loves Seattle, he came to visit me for a few days. In order to show off his shoes to our friends, I began to send photos of his shoes to our friends. Everyone seemed to love these photos of his shoe, thus beginning the saga of Zain Shoe.
